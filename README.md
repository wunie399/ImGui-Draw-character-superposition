# ImGui-Draw-character-superposition
Used for automatic superposition of ImGui string rendering, to prevent the unclear display when two strings of text are superimposed on the same plane coordinate. By default, it will be automatically superimposed upwards, and will be automatically adjusted according to the text size. Please use reference code for annotation in detail.
